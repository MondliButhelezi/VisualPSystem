# Visual Positioning App with AR and QR-based Indoor Navigation
This is a mobile app designed to provide users with an easy and intuitive way to navigate indoors, using augmented reality and QR code technology. The app works by scanning QR codes placed throughout a building, which serve as location markers. Once a user scans a QR code, the app will use augmented reality to display an arrow pointing in the direction of the next location marker, helping users navigate through the building.
